Hi, My name is Thomas McLean and this is my portfolio site. I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with 4+ experience. I also like Rock Climbing, DND, Writing, making cocktails, Pickleball and all things Tech. 

This site is meant for you to get to know me as a software engineer and as a person. If you have questions, feedback or simply interested in scheduling a conversation, feel free to contact me at Thomas.McLean993+contact@gmail.com.
