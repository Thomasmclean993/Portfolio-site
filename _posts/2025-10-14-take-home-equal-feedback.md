### I like take‑home assignments.

I’ve tried other interview formats, and honestly, I’m not a fan.
I know take‑homes aren’t for everyone.
If you’ve got kids to care for, a packed schedule, or simply don’t enjoy programming outside work hours, then take‑homes probably aren’t for you—and that’s fine.

Take‑homes work for me for a few reasons:

- They feel the closest to a normal workday.
- I rarely pair or mob.
- I like figuring things out on my own before seeking help.
- Take‑home assignments are usually based on real‑world problems.

So the following words are hard for me to say: I don’t want to do take‑homes anymore.

It’s not the time commitment or getting my local setup to cooperate with their app—it’s what happens afterwards.
After I send the project in.
After the rejection.
When I get no feedback at all.

For developers job‑hunting in this market, it’s already tough.
It feels like everyone is looking for work, but only senior, staff, and higher‑level engineers are getting hired.
When you apply, you’re competing against a lot of talented people.
Everyone’s trying to stand out—perfecting resumes, polishing side projects, contributing to open source—you name it, we’re doing it.

So after all that effort—landing the interview, completing the take‑home—when a dev gets rejected, the least a hiring manager or recruiter could do is send an email offering feedback on what to improve next time.

Many companies preach an “always be improving” mindset, but in software engineering that idea seems supercharged.
With AI, tight metrics, and constant pressure to deliver value, growth is more important than ever.
That’s why feedback matters—deeply.

If you don’t have time to give feedback, you don’t really have time to interview anyone.

**Peace out!** 🫶🏻
