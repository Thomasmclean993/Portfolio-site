I don’t remember exactly when I caught the coding bug. Maybe it started when I played Skyrim with a mod that was no longer being updated, and decided to fix it myself. Or maybe it was when I picked up _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ and learned Python just for fun. I even learned some HTML and CSS back in high school, making a scrolling banner on a static page.

But what I do know is that I’ve always loved problem-solving and creating something for others to enjoy. The funny thing is, I didn’t really become good at it until I became a bartender.

I’m forever grateful for my time as a server and bartender. The lessons I learned from meeting and talking to new people every day were invaluable. The biggest challenge? When someone would ask, “Can you make me a salty yet sweet drink, but not a margarita?” Suddenly, I had to come up with a solution on the spot for a complete stranger. That’s a tough problem—even on the slowest days.

At first, my approach was to learn everything about every spirit at the bar. Bourbon vs. scotch. Why some cocktails are shaken and others stirred. When to use Beefeater vs. Tanqueray. Sometimes this worked, but other times it was a complete failure—even when I thought I understood the guest’s taste. What was I missing?

I realized my process was the problem. I didn’t have ten years of experience, and I was trying to be perfect on the first try. Sure, I could follow a recipe and replicate a classic drink, but that rarely impressed anyone. So, I started doing what I now do in coding: I start with the process. What steps do I need to get to a solution? 

Let’s go back to that “not a margarita” request. Here were the requirements:

- Refreshing (it was a hot day, and it was brunch!)
- Tequila, but not too forward (the taste shouldn’t be overpowering)
- Still salty

So, basically a margarita—but not a margarita. I had my objectives. Next, I started building. Tequila would play a main role, but I needed to keep it balanced. Lime is an easy way to add refreshment, and if you get the balance right, it can carry the drink.

Here’s where the process comes in. I’d make enough of the drink to taste it, grab a straw, and test. This wasn’t a fancy New York bar, but once I started tasting and testing my experiments, I could narrow down the solution. The guest watching me loved watching my process.

Of course, I needed a sweetener, but simple syrup would be too much. We had honey syrup, which is lighter and pairs well with tequila and lime. Another taste—getting closer, but still missing the salty component. I also wanted this drink to be a real departure from a standard margarita.

It was a hot Saturday brunch downtown, and I spotted a bottle of champagne. Sometimes, creative solutions are necessary. After shaking the spirits, I poured the cocktail into a glass, floated some champagne on top, added a pinch of salt, and finished with a lime flag. One final end-to-end taste, and I handed it to the guest for review.

She loved it. In fact, I made that drink for her every time she came in. I kept the recipe for myself, but I did share it with her before I left that job.

If you ever feel lost, confused, or unsure of an answer—whether you’re behind the bar or behind a keyboard—I recommend looking at your process and seeing where things start to break down:

- Do you really understand the problem?
- Can you break it down into smaller parts?
- Are you creating and testing solutions along the way?


Knowing the problem gets you close, but understanding and refining your process can make your solution bulletproof.

Have a good one.
