<h6>My Recent Achievements</h6>

<ul>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <li><strong>Gateway API Solution:</strong>
    My team was previously paying ~$300,000 annually for a Gateway API that enabled our application to connect to two vendors. After a cost-to-time analysis, I designed and implemented a solution that allowed our team to cancel the contract and eliminate this expense.</li>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <li><strong>Application Monitoring:</strong>
    Leadership has directed that our team will no longer use Grafana and Sentry for monitoring applications in the future. To ensure application health, product performance, and efficient troubleshooting, I implemented logic to integrate our applications with Datadog, an observability platform.</li>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <li><strong>Prior Authorization Status Check:</strong>
    Previously, our team spent thousands of man hours manually contacting insurance companies to update statuses on prior authorizations. I developed an API to automate the retrieval of PA statuses, significantly reducing costs. This solution supports a product that generates over ~$20 million in revenue annually and saves the company millions in expenditures.</li>
