<h6>My Recent Achievements</h6>

<dl>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <dt><strong>Gateway API Solution</strong></dt>
    <dd>My team was previously paying ~$300,000 annually for a Gateway API that enabled our application to connect to two vendors. After a cost-to-time analysis, I designed and implemented a solution that allowed our team to cancel the contract and eliminate this expense.</dd>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <dt><strong>Application Monitoring</strong></dt>
    <dd>Leadership has directed that our team will no longer use Grafana and Sentry for monitoring applications in the future. To ensure application health, product performance, and efficient troubleshooting, I implemented logic to integrate our applications with Datadog, an observability platform.</dd>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-card">
    <dt><strong>Prior Authorization Status Check</strong></dt>
    <dd>Previously, our team spent thousands of man hours manually contacting insurance companies to update statuses on prior authorizations. I developed an API to automate the retrieval of PA statuses, significantly reducing costs. This solution supports a product that generates over ~$20 million in revenue annually and saves the company millions in expenditures.</dd>
