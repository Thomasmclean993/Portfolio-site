        <title>Task Management and My Second Brain</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was pairing with an intern the other day. They were a little confused about how some of my Elixir code behaved, so they started asking questions. After some back-and-forth, they hit me with a surprisingly good one: &lt;strong&gt;“What’s something you didn’t expect would be a challenge as a developer?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Added Custom Datadog Metrics using an Unsupported Language.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;First, let me address the elephant in the room: OpenTelemetry. Yes, I’m aware of the protocol, and my team could have used it. But due to some limiting factors, it wasn’t an option for us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Persistence Over Perfection, My Journey to Software Engineering</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned about myself, it’s that I rarely do things the “normal” way. While everyone else was busy racking up points in the Accelerated Reading program with the usual suspects—Magic Tree House, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Harry Potter—I was more interested in hacking my way through Deus Ex Machina: Human Evolution or setting my alarm for 4 a.m. to catch Cowboy Bebop reruns. I’ve always had a knack for finding my own path, especially when the standard route just didn’t make sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Bartending Made Me a Better Problem Solver</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember exactly when I caught the coding bug. Maybe it started when I played Skyrim with a mod that was no longer being updated, and decided to fix it myself. Or maybe it was when I picked up &lt;em&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&lt;/em&gt; and learned Python just for fun. I even learned some HTML and CSS back in high school, making a scrolling banner on a static page.&lt;/p&gt;
